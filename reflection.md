Reflection

Copilot helped me write the main parts of load_data and clean_column_names when I added comments above the functions. I prompted it by writing short notes like “load CSV from given path.”

I changed some things Copilot suggested: I renamed a variable in load_data and added .str.strip() in clean_column_names to clean extra spaces. I also added checks to handle missing or invalid columns.

I learned that Copilot is great for quickly generating starter code, but you still need to check and fix it. I also learned the importance of standardizing column names, stripping whitespace, and handling missing or negative values in data cleaning.
